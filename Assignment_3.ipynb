        "Ans: In programming, a function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are designed to be reusable, modular, and encapsulated units of code.Functions are essential for breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces of code, improving code organization, reusability, and maintainability. They allow you to create a modular structure in your programs and make your code more readable and maintainable."

When you define a function in Python using the def keyword, you are essentially telling Python what the function should do when it is called, but the code inside the function's body doesn't execute at that moment.The code within a function runs when you explicitly call that function in your program. The function definition merely specifies what should happen when it's called, but it doesn't execute the code until you invoke it with a function call."
